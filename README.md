# HTML6 Language Server

Enhance your editor with **HTML6 support** via this Language Server Protocol (LSP) extension. Get **syntax validation**, **hover info**, and **auto-completion** for custom HTML6 components.

    Quickly insert custom components using `<component></component>` snippets. The server dynamically reads all `<template is="...">` tags in your project for suggestions.

    New, modified, or deleted HTML files in your project automatically update the completion list.
